In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of Paul Atreides.

It was a warm summer evening at Castle Caladan, the old seat of House Atreides. The sun had just set over the sea beyond the low cliff edge, and a dampness was beginning to creep into the air from the fogbanks that rolled in from the distant ocean.

The old crone was a Bene Gesserit, one of the Reverend Mothers of the Sisterhood, who had been called to the Castle by Paul's mother, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica.

Old, the crone was - incredibly old, with the agelessness of the very aged, her face a labyrinth of wrinkles, her eyes sunken and piercing. She wore the traditional Bene Gesserit black robes, relieved only by the silver cord of her order, and the golden chain around her neck, from which hung the locket of her office.

The crone, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, did not appear on any census rolls of the Empire's population. Those records were for the profane masses, the cattle of the empire. No record of a Reverend Mother's existence was ever made. It was as if she did not exist.

And yet, the Reverend Mother was there, seated in a chair of polished and intricately carved wood, her eyes fixed on the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica who stood before her.

"You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides," the crone said, her voice husky with age, yet sharp as a splinter.

Jessica nodded, a small, worried motion of the head.

"But you bore a son," the Reverend Mother continued, "and you know the reason."

Jessica's hands were clenched into fists at her sides. "I was not supposed to know," she said.

The Reverend Mother nodded. "But you knew, didn't you? When you conceived this child, you knew what you were doing."

Jessica took a deep breath. "I was... drawn," she said.

The Reverend Mother nodded again. "You were drawn. You were drawn to give the Atreides a son, and thus you gave him a son."

Jessica took another deep breath. "What does this have to do with our going to Arrakis?"

The Reverend Mother smiled, a thin, mirthless smile. "Arrakis," she said, "will be your son's destiny. And, perhaps, his destruction."
