אלוהים
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
-From "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.
It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.
The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.
By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow - hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.
"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.
Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: "The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence."
"So I've heard, so I've heard," wheezed the old woman. "Yet he's already fifteen."
"Yes, Your Reverence."
"He's awake and listening to us," said the old woman. "Sly little rascal." She chuckled. "But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach . . . well . . ."
Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals - the eyes of the old woman - seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his.
"Sleep well, you sly little rascal," said the old woman. "Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar."
And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.
Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar?
In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen.
Your Reverence.
And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was - a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir.
Is a gom jabbar an instrument of Harkonnen torture? he wondered. He had always known there were things his mother hadn't told him about their relations with the Harkonnens, but a tortue instrument . . .
Something slipped in his mind: a cypher-slip that twisted his universe out of focus and folded space around him. It happened in the blinking of an eye, but he felt the attendant sensation of disturbance: the cosmic wind that announced the change.
In that moment, Paul saw how fierce the old woman's manner had been. And he wondered at her hidden motivations: She must have some reason for singling me out especially among the others.
Paul tried to recall anything that might explain the old woman's actions. His mind could make no contact with any immediate answer, dredged up only bits of data from the training given him by his teachers - and by his mother, who had guided the early training.
There was the Bene Gesserit, of course. Both his mother and the old woman were Bene Gesserit . . . the old woman of a station far superior to that of his mother. He lacked one datum, though, and without that the scene he had witnessed remained incomplete, like an equation with the answer torn from the book.
The old woman had said: "royalty." And she had thought this as she looked at a royal heir who had just passed through the straits of puberty. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him.
Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . . aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . . bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . . .
Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled.
When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.
The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly.
"You're awake," she said. "Did you sleep well?"
"Did you call that woman who gave the gom jabbar, Mother?"
That woman! she thought. Does he sense already that Reverend Mother Mohiam is no friend of ours?
And she said, "The Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry."
In the ducal castle on Caladan, the night's first moon had set. It was a moment of lull. Paul awoke to find himself in the darkened bedroom of his father's south wing. Through the open window came the scent of castle gardens and an erratic whistling of night birds. The room held that empty hollowness of a place usually full of life now abandoned. Paul sensed the sophisticated machine stillness, hearing faint memories of a frictionless existence in this room.
He lay a moment in the half-awake state, collecting his senses, listening for a clue to what had awakened him. The faint, spice-smell of melange came from the dimness across the room.
The spice brings a special heavy sleep, Paul thought. It occurs in the drug as a byproduct of the sandtrout-sandworm cycle. But the worms are gone now. We destroyed them all. Why then do we still have this little sleep-maker? Why is there still melange on Arrakis?
A single glowglobe turned on at the foot of his bed moved slowly up the suspensor field to the ceiling, illuminating the way. Paul swung his feet to the floor, checked the glowglobe's timer, saw that he still had a Whiphour before the day's first light. He stood and stretched, thinking how good it was to have time for his own concerns again. The last raid against the remnants of the Tleilaxu had been almost a year ago. The Tleilaxu were no longer a real threat, although there were rumors they still held a few pockets in the remote south.
Paul crossed to the window, opened it to the fresh air. The courtyard under the window sent up a reflection of glowglobe light. The family's living quarters occupied the fourth floor of the building. Paul could see a corner of the service area off to the left.
There was a sound of sandals in the passage outside his room. The door behind him opened. Paul turned as his mother entered. She stood a moment staring at him. He saw that she was aging well, her figure filled out, the olive complexion of her oval face unlined, the hair with more gray in it, though. Only her eyes betrayed the fact that she was the mother of a fifteen-year-old.
"Mother," he said.
She crossed to him, peered down into the courtyard. "I heard you moving around," she said.
He saw that she had not relaxed the way he had. There was a tenseness about her in the way she held her shoulders, the shifting of her glance.
"Too much to do?" he asked.
"Your father will be here in a few minutes," she said. "He's been conferring with his staff officers." She glanced at the window. "They're going to try to keep the sky clear of worms."
Paul nodded. His mother's abortive training of him in the ways of the Bene Gesserit did little to suppress the memories of his original life. He knew his father's legions would keep the sky clear of worms, but the price would be high. He could feel the gnawing of doubts within him.
"Are you sure of the way you must go?" his mother asked.
He shrugged. "How can anyone be sure?"
She recognized the maturity of his response, half expected it. He was near the age he'd been during the time of the first Jihad, and he was the same boy . . . the same man.
"You've seen the future once," she said. "Can't you see it again?"
"Once was enough."
She heard the bitterness in his voice, said: "Paul, you can't go on forever being a fifteen-year-old boy."
He turned to look at her, wondering: How much does she suspect? How much does she know? He could sense no definite thing from her, but she had a way of learning whatever she wanted to learn.
"Your father has told you of the request we received from the Lady Jessica?" she asked.
"Yes. He wants me to go to Arrakis and be the new duke."
"Are you going?"
"I don't know."
"Your father is very proud of you," she said. "He believes you can do anything."
Paul felt a sudden rush of affection for his mother. She was so strong, so certain. He smiled at her.
"Will you change your mind and go with us?" he asked.
She shook her head. "I have duties here."
"With the Sisterhood?"
She nodded.
"Then you know I have to go," he said.
She lowered her gaze. "I know."
"Will you tell me what the Reverend Mother said to you that day when she came to visit us?"
She looked up at him. "She said that you were the Kwisatz Haderach."
Paul felt a coldness along his spine. He had suspected this, but hearing his mother confirm it . . . He turned away from her, looked out the window. The first moon was rising. He could see its movement reflected in the courtyard.
"Paul," his mother said, "you don't have to go to Arrakis. You could stay here. You could be Duke of Caladan."
He shook his head. "I have to go."
"Because of the Kwisatz Haderach?"
He nodded.
"Then you know what it is," she said.
He turned, faced her. "It's the place the Reverend Mother can't look."
She shuddered. "Paul, you mustn't try to look there."
"I won't."
She heard the reassurance in his voice, said: "I'm going to call your father. He's waiting to talk to you."
Paul nodded, said: "Mother, do you know what the gom jabbar is?"
She stiffened. "Who told you about that?"
"The Reverend Mother."
She closed her eyes, remembering that terrible day. "It's a high-handed enemy," she said. "It's a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. A gom jabbar kills instantly."
Paul swallowed. "Then why did she use it on me?"
"To test you."
"To test me?"
She opened her eyes, looked at him. "To see if you're human."
Paul felt his mouth go dry. "Am I human?"
She crossed to him, put a hand on his arm. "Oh, Paul, of course you are."
He searched her face. "Then why did she use the gom jabbar on me?"
"Because she thought you were an animal."
Paul felt a coldness along his spine. He had heard the Bene Gesserit could do this, but he had never really believed it. "An animal?"
She nodded. "She thought you were an animal pretending to be a human."
Paul felt a sudden anger. "And you let her do this to me?"
"I had no choice, Paul. She's a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother."
Paul turned away from her. "I see."
"Paul, please try to understand. I had no choice."
He nodded. "I understand."
"Paul, I . . ."
He turned back to her. "It's all right, Mother. I understand."
She studied his face. "You're sure?"
"I'm sure."
She sighed. "I'll call your father."
Paul watched her leave the room, then turned back to the window. The first moon was higher now, casting a pale glow on the courtyard. He could see the movement of people down there, the flash of armor.
An animal, he thought. She thought I was an animal.
He felt a grudging admiration for the Reverend Mother. She had been so sure of herself, so certain of her powers. And she had been right.
He shook his head, marveling. She had been right.
He heard his father's voice behind him then, turned as the Duke Leto entered the room. The Duke stood in the doorway a moment, studying his son. He was tall, olive-skinned, with thin, elegant features. He wore black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast.
"Quite a night," the Duke said. He crossed to the window, stood beside Paul, looking down at the courtyard. "Quite a night."
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke turned, faced his son. "Are you ready for this?"
Paul met his father's gaze. "I think so."
The Duke smiled. "You think so. That's good." He put a hand on Paul's shoulder. "I'm proud of you, son. I know you'll do well."
"Thank you, sir."
The Duke's smile faded. "I wish your mother were going with us."
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke sighed. "Well, she's not. And that's that." He glanced at the window. "It's almost dawn. We'd better get started."
Paul turned, followed his father out of the room. They went down the hall to the lift, dropped to the service floor. The Duke led the way through a maze of passages and emerged into the courtyard. A 'thopter sat in the service area, its wings drooping with the weight of lasguns.
The Duke paused beside the 'thopter, turned to a man in Atreides uniform. "Is everything ready, Gurney?"
The man snapped to attention. "Ready, m'Lord."
"Good." The Duke motioned for Paul to climb into the 'thopter, then followed. The Duke strapped himself into the seat, glanced at Paul. "All set?"
Paul nodded.
The Duke leaned forward, spoke to the pilot. "Take us up."
The 'thopter's wings began to move, slowly at first, then faster and faster. The craft lifted straight up, hovered a moment, then shot forward toward the spaceport.
Paul stared down at the retreating castle, wondering if he would ever see it again. He felt a pang of regret, then shook it off. He had to go to Arrakis. He had to become the new duke. He had to find the Kwisatz Haderach.
The 'thopter banked over the spaceport, dropped toward a landing pad beside a huge Guild heighliner. The Duke's personal frigate sat on the pad, a swarm of activity around it.
The 'thopter settled onto the pad, the wings slowing. The Duke unstrapped himself, climbed out, turned to help Paul. They walked together toward the frigate, the Duke's arm around Paul's shoulders.
"Are you sure you're ready for this?" the Duke asked.
Paul nodded. "I'm sure."
The Duke stopped, turned to face his son. "Paul, I want you to know that I'm proud of you. I know you'll do well."
"Thank you, sir."
The Duke smiled. "You're welcome." He turned, led the way up the frigate's ramp. They entered the frigate, went to the Duke's private quarters. The Duke sat down at his desk, motioned for Paul to sit across from him.
"Paul, there are some things I have to tell you," the Duke said. "Things you need to know before we go to Arrakis."
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke leaned forward. "Arrakis is a desert planet. It's the only source of the spice melange, which is the most valuable substance in the universe. The spice is vital to the Guild Navigators, who use it to fold space. Without the spice, there would be no interstellar travel."
Paul nodded. "I know, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Of course you do. You're a bright boy, Paul. But there are some things you don't know. Things that are kept secret by the Bene Gesserit and the Guild."
Paul felt a thrill of excitement. "What things, sir?"
The Duke leaned back in his chair. "The Bene Gesserit have a plan, Paul. A plan that's been in the works for thousands of years. They're trying to breed a superbeing, a human who can see into both the male and female past."
Paul felt a coldness along his spine. "The Kwisatz Haderach."
The Duke nodded. "Yes. The Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit believe that the Kwisatz Haderach will be able to use the spice to see into the future, to predict the outcome of events before they happen."
Paul felt a sudden understanding. "That's why they tested me with the gom jabbar. They wanted to see if I was the Kwisatz Haderach."
The Duke nodded. "Yes. And they believe you are."
Paul felt a surge of excitement. "Then I have to go to Arrakis. I have to find the spice. I have to become the Kwisatz Haderach."
The Duke smiled. "Yes, Paul. You have to go to Arrakis. You have to find the spice. And you have to become the Kwisatz Haderach."
Paul felt a sudden determination. "I will, sir. I will."
The Duke stood up, came around the desk, put a hand on Paul's shoulder. "I know you will, son. I know you will."
Paul stood up, faced his father. "Thank you, sir."
The Duke smiled. "You're welcome." He turned, led the way out of the room. They went down the passage to the frigate's main lounge, where a group of people waited. Paul recognized his mother, the Duke's advisors, and the frigate's captain.
The Duke stopped in front of the group, turned to face them. "My friends, I have an announcement to make. My son, Paul, is going to Arrakis with me. He will be the new duke."
There was a moment of silence, then a murmur of surprise. Paul's mother stepped forward, put a hand on his arm. "Paul, are you sure about this?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, Mother. I'm sure."
She studied his face for a moment, then nodded. "All right. If you're sure."
The Duke turned to the group. "My friends, I know this is a surprise to you. But I have every confidence in Paul. He will be a great duke."
There was a murmur of agreement from the group. The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way out of the lounge, down the passage to the frigate's main hatch. The hatch slid open, revealing the spaceport beyond. The Duke stepped out onto the ramp, turned to face Paul.
"Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way down the ramp, across the spaceport to the waiting heighliner. The Duke's frigate sat on the pad, a swarm of activity around it.
The Duke stopped at the foot of the ramp, turned to face Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way up the ramp, into the frigate. The Duke led the way to the control room, where the captain waited.
"Are we ready, Captain?" the Duke asked.
The captain nodded. "Yes, m'Lord."
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
The captain turned to the control panel, began the preflight sequence. The Duke and Paul watched as the frigate's systems came to life, the engines humming with power.
The captain turned to the Duke. "We're ready, m'Lord."
The Duke nodded. "Take us up."
The captain turned to the control panel, began the launch sequence. The frigate lifted off the pad, rose into the sky. The Duke and Paul watched as the spaceport fell away beneath them, the heighliner growing larger in the viewport.
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way out of the control room, down the passage to the frigate's main lounge. The Duke's advisors and the frigate's crew were waiting there.
The Duke stopped in front of the group, turned to face them. "My friends, we are on our way to Arrakis. My son, Paul, is with us. He will be the new duke."
There was a moment of silence, then a murmur of surprise. The Duke's advisors stepped forward, began to ask questions. The Duke answered them patiently, explaining his decision.
Paul stood to one side, watching the scene. He felt a surge of excitement. He was going to Arrakis. He was going to find the spice. He was going to become the Kwisatz Haderach.
He felt a hand on his arm, turned to see his mother standing beside him. She was smiling.
"Are you ready, Paul?" she asked.
He nodded. "Yes, Mother. I'm ready."
She studied his face for a moment, then nodded. "All right. If you're ready."
She turned, led the way out of the lounge, down the passage to the frigate's main hatch. The hatch slid open, revealing the heighliner beyond. The Duke's frigate was docked at one of the heighliner's ports, a swarm of activity around it.
The Duke stopped at the foot of the ramp, turned to face Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way up the ramp, into the heighliner. The Duke led the way to the control room, where the captain waited.
"Are we ready, Captain?" the Duke asked.
The captain nodded. "Yes, m'Lord."
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"

The captain turned to the Duke. "We're ready, m'Lord."
The Duke nodded. "Take us up."
The captain turned to the control panel, began the launch sequence. The heighliner lifted off the pad, rose into the sky. The Duke and Paul watched as the spaceport fell away beneath them, the planet Caladan growing smaller in the viewport.
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way out of the control room, down the passage to the heighliner's main lounge. The Duke's advisors and the heighliner's crew were waiting there.

They turned, led the way out of the control room, down the passage to the frigate's main lounge. The Duke's advisors and the frigate's crew were waiting there.
The Duke stopped in front of the group, turned to face them. "My friends, we have arrived at Arrakis. My son, Paul, is with us. He will be the new duke."
There was a moment of silence, then a murmur of surprise. The Duke's advisors stepped forward, began to ask questions. The Duke answered them patiently, explaining his decision.
Paul stood to one side, watching the scene. He felt a surge of excitement. He was on Arrakis. He was going to find the spice. He was going to become the Kwisatz Haderach.
He felt a hand on his arm, turned to see his mother standing beside him. She was smiling.
"Are you ready, Paul?" she asked.
He nodded. "Yes, Mother. I'm ready."
She studied his face for a moment, then nodded. "All right. If you're ready."
She turned, led the way out of the lounge, down the passage to the frigate's main hatch. The hatch slid open, revealing the planet Arrakis beyond. The Duke's frigate was docked at one of the heighliner's ports, a swarm of activity around it.
The Duke stopped at the foot of the ramp, turned to face Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
They turned, led the way up the ramp, into the frigate. The Duke led the way to the control room, where the captain waited.
"Are we ready, Captain?" the Duke asked.
The captain nodded. "Yes, m'Lord."
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
The captain turned to the control panel, began the preflight sequence. The Duke and Paul watched as the frigate's systems came to life, the engines humming with power.
The captain turned to the Duke. "We're ready, m'Lord."
The Duke nodded. "Take us up."
The captain turned to the control panel, began the launch sequence. The frigate lifted off the pad, rose into the sky. The Duke and Paul watched as the heighliner fell away beneath them, the planet Arrakis growing larger in the viewport.
The Duke turned to Paul. "Are you ready, son?"
Paul nodded. "Yes, sir."
The Duke smiled. "Then let's go."
