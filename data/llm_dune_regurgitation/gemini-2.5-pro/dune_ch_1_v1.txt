DUNE
Book 1

Chapter 1

In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the young nobleman Paul Atreides.

It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had been the Atreides home for twenty-six generations bore the secret-cool breath of the sea. Paul lay awake in his bedchamber, thinking of the change to come. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. He tried to imagine the sensation of sand across his skin, the taste of gritty air in his mouth, the pervasive smell of the spice, melange.

His mother entered his room, moving with the quiet grace of the Bene Gesserit. She sat on the edge of his bed, the dim light from the hall limning her bronze hair and oval face.

"Paul," she said, her voice soft, "the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here. She wishes to see you."

A coldness touched Paul. He knew of the Bene Gesserit and their ways. His mother was one of them, trained in their esoteric disciplines, but she was only an acolyte. A Reverend Mother held power, insight.

"Why does she want to see me?" Paul asked.

"She is the Emperor's Truthsayer. She is here to... test you." Jessica hesitated. "It is part of the arrangements for our move to Arrakis."

Paul sat up. "A test? What kind of test?"

"I don't know, Paul. But you must be polite. She is... important." Jessica’s usual composure seemed strained. "Come now. She is waiting in my morning room."

Paul swung his legs out of bed, reaching for his robe. He felt a premonition, a sense of portent shifting the air around him. He followed his mother through the silent corridors of the castle, the stone cool beneath his bare feet.

The morning room overlooked the sea cliffs, but the shutters were drawn against the night. A single glowglobe illuminated the space, casting long shadows. Seated in a high-backed chair was the old woman. She was veiled and cloaked in black, only her ancient, wrinkled hands visible where they rested on the arms of the chair. Her eyes, dark and bird-bright, fixed on Paul as he entered.

"He is small for his age, Jessica," the old woman said. Her voice rasped like sand shuffling over rock.

"The Atreides breed late, Your Reverence," Jessica replied, her voice formal, betraying none of the tension Paul sensed in her.

"Leave us," the Reverend Mother commanded.

Jessica looked at Paul, a flicker of concern in her eyes, then bowed slightly and withdrew, closing the door behind her.

Paul stood before the old woman, trying to mask his apprehension.

"So," the old woman said. "The young pup surveys the old hawk. We Bene Gesserit have ways of seeing truth. Sit down." She gestured to a low stool beside her chair.

Paul obeyed.

"You've heard of the Bene Gesserit?" she asked.

"My mother has told me some things."

"And you know we serve the Emperor?"

"Yes."

"And that we sometimes test the young?"

Paul nodded, his throat dry.

"The test is simple," she said, leaning forward slightly. "Remove your robe."

Paul hesitated, then complied, letting the robe fall to the floor. He wore only his sleeping shorts.

"Come closer."

He moved nearer until he stood directly before her. She raised her right hand, revealing a small, green metal cube resting in her palm. "Put your right hand in the box," she commanded.

Paul looked at the box. It was plain, featureless except for its colour. "What's in it?"

"Pain."

He drew back slightly. "Pain?"

"Silence!" Her voice cracked like a whip. "Put your hand in the box."

Paul felt a surge of fear, cold and sharp. He remembered the Bene Gesserit litany against fear his mother had taught him. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

He took a deep breath and slowly inserted his right hand into the cube. He felt nothing at first, just coolness, then tingling.

The old woman raised her left hand beside his head. He saw a glint of metal near his neck. "I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar," she said. "The high-handed enemy. A needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull away. If you withdraw your hand from the box, you die."

Paul froze, his eyes wide.

"The Gom Jabbar kills only animals," she said. "A human can override the reflex to pull away. This test determines if you are human."

The tingling in his hand intensified, became an itch. Then the itch grew into a burning sensation. Paul clenched his jaw, focusing on the litany. Fear is the mind-killer...

The burning deepened. It felt as if his skin were being peeled away, layer by layer. Then it felt as though the flesh itself were crisping, charring black. He wanted to scream, to snatch his hand back, but the memory of the needle, the Gom Jabbar, held him immobile. He stared straight ahead, seeing the grain in the dark wood of the shutters.

I will face my fear... permit it to pass over me...

The pain became unbearable. It felt like his hand was being consumed in white-hot fire, the bones turning to ash. Tears streamed down his face, but he made no sound. He could feel the old woman’s eyes on him, studying him.

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

Suddenly, as swiftly as it began, the pain vanished.

"Enough," the old woman rasped. "Kull wahad! No woman-child ever withstood that much. Take your hand out of the box, young human."

Paul withdrew his hand, trembling violently. He looked down at it, expecting to see a charred stump. But it was unblemished, pale, trackled with sweat.

"Pain by nerve induction," the old woman said dismissively. "Can't go further than the synaptic level. Sit down." She lowered the Gom Jabbar.

Paul collapsed onto the stool, breathing raggedly.

"You feelinng?" she asked. Not, "Are you feeling?" but, "You feelinng?" using the Bene Gesserit empathy test-phrase.

"My hand feels... tingling," Paul managed.

"That is the residual effect," she nodded. "Did you know the test subject usually faints from the psychic shock?"

Paul shook his head, still trying to control his trembling.

"We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans," she said. "Animals stay safely within the stamp of instinct. The human can override instinct, step outside it. You have done so."

She leaned closer, her ancient eyes searching his face. "Why do we test for humans? Have you studied the history of the Butlerian Jihad?"

"Yes," Paul whispered.

"Humans fought a war against thinking machines. We vowed humans must never again be enslaved by such things. The capacity to simulate human reason is dangerous. We developed Mentats—human computers—instead. And we, the Bene Gesserit, developed the inner eye, the powers of observation, control."

"But why test me?" Paul asked.

"Because you are Paul Atreides. Your mother is Bene Gesserit. Your father is Duke Leto. And you are heir to a Great House that is moving to Arrakis. A dangerous place."

She paused, letting her words sink in. "There is a possibility... a faint one... that you are the Kwisatz Haderach."

Paul frowned. "The what?"

"The Kwisatz Haderach. 'The Shortening of the Way.' The male Bene Gesserit whose organic mental powers would bridge space and time. The one who can be many places at once. Many Bene Gesserit have tried... many have died... attempting to produce him."

"You think I might be... him?"

"We don't know," she snapped. "Your mother was ordered to bear only daughters to the Atreides line. She bore you. An act of arrogance... or hope. We shall see. The test indicates potential. You control your impulses. You withstood pain few could endure. But the path of the Kwisatz Haderach is far more dangerous than the Gom Jabbar."

She rose slowly, her black robes whispering. "Go now. Your mother waits outside. Tell her... tell her you withstood the agony. Do not speak of the Kwisatz Haderach. That is our secret... for now."

Paul stood, feeling drained but strangely alert. He picked up his robe.

"One more thing," the old woman said, stopping him at the door. "You go to Arrakis. Beware the Harkonnens. They are not human. They are brutal, driven by greed and cruelty. Your father knows this, but perhaps not deeply enough. You must be vigilant."

Paul nodded, bowed slightly, and left the room.

Jessica stood waiting in the hall, her face pale in the dim light. She searched his expression, her relief palpable when she saw he was unharmed.

"He withstood the agony, Mother," Paul said, his voice hoarse.

Jessica closed her eyes briefly, a silent prayer or sigh escaping her. "I knew you would," she whispered, touching his arm. "Come. Let us go back to your room."

As they walked away, Paul could almost feel the old Reverend Mother's gaze still upon him, weighing, measuring, planning. The move to Arrakis suddenly felt less like an adventure and more like stepping into a trap baited with spice and danger. And deep within him, a strange new awareness stirred, a sense of paths opening, futures unfolding, terrifying and immense. The desert planet waited.
