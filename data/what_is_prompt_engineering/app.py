    ## Understanding Prompt Engineering
    
    Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs to AI systems to elicit desired outputs. It's a key skill for effectively using large language models.
    
    ### Why Prompt Engineering Matters
    
    The same model can produce dramatically different results based solely on how you frame your prompt. This demo lets you experience this firsthand by comparing different techniques:
    
    - **Basic Prompting**: Direct questions yield direct answers, but may lack depth or context
    - **Role-Based Prompting**: Giving the AI a persona or expertise lens changes its perspective
    - **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Requesting explicit reasoning steps improves accuracy for complex tasks
    - **Chain of Thought**: Extended reasoning that connects concepts leads to more comprehensive answers
    - **Few-Shot Learning**: Showing examples of desired outputs helps the model understand your expectations
    
    ### Experiment Tips
    
    - Try the same query with different techniques to see how responses vary
    - Adjust the temperature to see how it affects output creativity vs. precision
    - For complex questions, compare basic prompting with reasoning-based techniques
    - For domain-specific questions, try role-based prompting with relevant expertise
