## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of attention mechanisms in large language models. We examine the evolution from basic attention to more sophisticated mechanisms like multi-head attention, sparse attention, and linear attention variants. Our analysis covers both the theoretical foundations and practical implementations across different model architectures.

## Key Contributions
