## [#19901](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/19901) - Fallback sliding window to v0 and fix CPU pooling model tests

#### Overview
This PR addresses a critical compatibility issue with sliding window attention models running on CPU backends. The V1 engine's CPU chunked prefill attention kernel lacks support for sliding window attention, causing failures when attempting to run models with this feature on CPU. The fix implements an automatic fallback mechanism to the V0 engine and includes targeted test improvements for CPU embedding models.

The sliding window attention mechanism is used by models like Mistral and Qwen2 to limit the attention span to a fixed window size, reducing memory usage and computational complexity for long sequences. However, the CPU implementation in vLLM's V1 engine has not yet been updated to support this feature, necessitating graceful fallback to the more mature V0 engine.

**Explanation**: 
- The core fix adds a check in the `_is_v1_supported_oracle` method to detect when a model with sliding window attention is being used on a CPU platform
- Uses `model_config.get_sliding_window()` to check if the model configuration specifies a sliding window size
- Calls `_raise_or_fallback()` with appropriate error messaging to either raise an exception or gracefully fallback to V0
- The `recommend_to_remove=False` parameter indicates this is a platform limitation, not a user configuration error
- This ensures CPU workloads automatically use the V0 engine when sliding window models are detected

**Explanation**: 
- Adds `pytest.mark.cpu_model` marker to the Qwen2-7B embedding model test
- This marker helps categorize CPU-specific tests and enables selective test execution
- The model already skips V0 engine due to embedding-related issues, now it's properly marked for CPU testing scenarios

**Explanation**: 
- Adds a specific skip condition for the e5-mistral-7b-instruct model when running on CPU with V1 engine enabled
- The model uses sliding window attention (Mistral architecture), which is unsupported by CPU V1 kernel
- Checks environment variable `VLLM_USE_V1` to determine if V1 engine is explicitly requested
- Provides clear skip message explaining the limitation to help developers understand the constraint

#### PR Discussion & Comments

**@gemini-code-assist[bot] → @bigPYJ1151** — Automated summary and code review analysis
"This pull request primarily addresses compatibility issues with models utilizing sliding window attention on CPU, ensuring proper fallback to the V0 engine where the V1 CPU kernel lacks support."

**@gemini-code-assist[bot] → @bigPYJ1151** — Technical validation of approach
"The code changes are well-targeted and appear correct: In vllm/engine/arg_utils.py, the modification to _is_v1_supported_oracle correctly adds logic to detect if a model with a sliding window is running on a CPU."

**@DarkLight1337 → @bigPYJ1151** — Maintainer approval
The PR received approval from a core maintainer without additional comments, indicating the fix properly addresses the known limitation.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Architecture Compatibility**: Different vLLM engine versions have varying feature support matrices - V1's CPU backend lacks sliding window attention support while V0 maintains it
- **Graceful Degradation**: The fallback mechanism demonstrates proper error handling by automatically selecting the most compatible engine rather than failing outright
- **Test Infrastructure**: Proper test marking and conditional skipping helps maintain CI reliability across different platform and engine configurations
- **Environment-Aware Testing**: Using environment variables like `VLLM_USE_V1` allows fine-grained control over engine selection in test scenarios
- **Performance Trade-offs**: While V0 engine supports more features, V1 engine offers performance improvements - this fix ensures functionality over optimization when features conflict
