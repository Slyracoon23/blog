## [#19624](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/19624) - Fix DP Coordinator incorrect debug log message

#### Overview
This PR fixes a logging bug in the Data Parallel (DP) Coordinator where debug messages were showing incorrect wave numbers. The coordinator was logging `"Moving DP wave from N to N"` instead of the correct `"Moving DP wave from N to (N + 1)"`. This affects the V1 engine's data parallel processing wave management system.

**Motivation**: Accurate debug logging is crucial for troubleshooting distributed processing coordination issues in vLLM's V1 engine architecture.

#### Code Changes (Verified)

**Explanation**: 

- **Main Fix**: Introduced a `new_wave` variable to compute `wave + 1` before logging, ensuring the debug message shows the correct transition from current wave to next wave

- **Code Refactoring**: Moved the stale wave check inside the `if not self.engines_running` block for better logical grouping (noted as "unrelated simplification" by author)

- **Variable Extraction**: Extracted `scheduler_stats` to a local variable to avoid repeated attribute access, improving code readability

#### PR Discussion & Comments

> **Development Team Discussion:**
> 
> **@njhill** commented on code organization improvement:  
> *"This is unrelated simplification, this check only applies to the case inside the if."*
> 
> **@njhill** identified the main bug:  
> *"This is the actual bug fix"*

#### Key Takeaways
- **Bug Impact**: Incorrect debug logging can mislead developers during troubleshooting of distributed processing coordination
- **Simple but Important**: The fix demonstrates how even small logging errors should be corrected for proper debugging experience
- **Code Quality**: The PR also includes minor refactoring improvements alongside the main fix
- **V1 Engine Context**: This affects the newer V1 engine architecture's data parallel processing system
