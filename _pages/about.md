üëã Hi, my name is Maxime Labonne and I'm a research scientist in machine learning & deep learning at ‚úàÔ∏è **Airbus Defence and Space**. I have a **PhD in machine learning** applied to cyber security from the **Polytechnic Institute of Paris** (number 49 in QS World University Rankings). I've worked for the **French Atomic Energy Commission**, where I developed new machine learning architectures dedicated to anomaly detection and that are now **sold and used in various industrial, national, and European projects**. 

In this blog, I want to write **tutorials and guides** about AI in a different way. I want to **start with practice and implementation**, and then move on to explanations. Even better, I would like to **experimentally retrace the thought process of the original authors** of the algorithms we use everyday to understand their design, the importance of each component, rather than using them as **black boxes**. Implementation is at the core of this process, since it is only by implementing by yourself that you discover **all the assumptions and other details that are often ignored**, but that also explain a lot. Finally, I think this process is fun and allows you to **practice tackling difficult problems to design new and suitable machine learning solutions**.

I hope we can have fun together and learn a few things along the way. :)
