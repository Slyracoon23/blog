## Week 4 (Apr 22–Apr 28)

**Health & Fitness:**
I arrived at the gym on Tuesday stiff from weekend hiking, but after my usual 10-minute foam-rolling warm-up, I managed three solid sessions. Thursday was electric: after eight tries and a mental pep talk, I stuck the crux sequence on the V4 line "Blue Slab Monster." 🎯 My shoulders ached, but that sweet send adrenaline made it worth every pump. I skipped hangboard this week—my coach reminded me that more climbing variety beats over-focusing on one tool.

**Career:**
Monday involved a deep dive into alignment theory as I wrapped up Module 5 of the certification. By Wednesday afternoon, I had polished my slides for Friday's brown-bag talk on "Scaling Reward Models Safely." 🎤 The talk went smoothly—questions around failure modes sparked a great team discussion, and my manager gave positive feedback.

**Personal Learning:**
Blog post #1 on RAG + Mistral went live Wednesday. I embedded interactive HF Spaces demos, which garnered over 200 clicks in the first 24 hours. 🚀 That evening I sketched the outline for post #2 on custom retrieval pipelines—something I can't wait to explore further.

<aside>
💡 **Reflection:** Balancing physical fatigue with creative energy is a dance. Pacing my hangboard routine will be key to avoid burnout.
</aside>

## Week 3 (Apr 15–Apr 21)

**Health & Fitness:**
After tweaking a finger pulley last week, I started gentle fingerboard hangs (2x20min) focusing on tendon-friendly grips. Climbed twice, dialing in on heel hooks and flagging. On Sunday I nearly topped a V4—fell just below the final jug. 💪 Confidence is mounting.

**Career:**
Completed 3 of 5 modules in the advanced alignment course, each with dense reading on robust delegation and interpretability. I drafted the initial technical proposal for our new embedding architecture and scheduled a review with my lead next Tuesday. 📊

**Personal Learning:**
This week was all about code cleanup. API changes in Transformers v5 broke my RAG examples, so I spent two evenings refactoring. Documentation now includes a troubleshooting section, making it easier for readers to follow. 🛠️

<aside>
📘 **Learning:** Good code is as much about error messages as functionality—clear logs save hours of debugging.
</aside>

---

## Week 2 (Apr 8–Apr 14)

**Health & Fitness:**
Three sessions on steep overhangs taught me the power of rest pauses at knee bars. My footwork improved dramatically—a small tweak in technique that felt like unlocking a secret level. 🔑

**Career:**
Dove into Module 1 and 2 of the AI alignment cert. The unit on "human feedback loops" sparked ideas for an internal tooling dashboard. I also hosted a one-hour mini-workshop for a junior engineer on prompt de-biasing techniques. 👨‍🏫

**Personal Learning:**
Sketching the RAG blog post outline felt cathartic. I mapped key sections: introduction, dataset prep, retrieval tuning, and analysis. Still haven't started writing, but the roadmap is clear. 🗺️

<aside>
🗺️ **Takeaway:** Outlining first avoids blank-page paralysis.
</aside>

---

## Week 1 (Apr 1–Apr 7)

**Health & Fitness:**
Eased into April with two gym days focusing on balance drills and slow foot placements. Completed three distinct V3 lines—felt stable in my stance for the first time. 🧘‍♂️

**Career:**
Closed out Q1 with an end-of-quarter retrospective. Leadership greenlit my embedding model proof-of-concept; now I need to draft milestones and risk assessments. 📈

**Personal Learning:**
Gathered 10+ research papers on retrieval-augmented generation. Spent hours highlighting key quotes and diagrams. The draft outline for my next blog post is forming in my notebook. 📚

<aside>
🎯 **Planning:** Q2 intentions defined—time to shift from ideation to execution.
