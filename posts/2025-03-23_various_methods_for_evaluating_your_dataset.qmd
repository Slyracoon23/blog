Proper evaluation is crucial for understanding language model capabilities. Here are several key methods used in frameworks like EleutherAI's lm-evaluation-harness:

The evaluation methods discussed below focus on assessing model generations and outputs, not training-related metrics like loss functions. While model training objectives and evaluation can be interlinked, this guide specifically addresses post-training evaluation techniques that measure the quality and usefulness of model outputs rather than optimizing the training process itself.
:::

## 1. Human Evaluation Methods

- **Direct Assessment**: Human evaluators rate model outputs on dimensions like helpfulness, accuracy, harmlessness, and overall quality.
- **Comparative Judgment**: Evaluators choose between outputs from different models without knowing their source, establishing relative quality.
- **Structured Annotation**: Detailed feedback using specific rubrics to evaluate particular aspects of model performance.

## 2. LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Using capable language models to choose between two model outputs, scaling evaluation while maintaining correlation with human judgments.
- **Absolute Scoring**: LLM judges rating individual responses on specific criteria using predefined scales.
- **Rubric-Based Evaluation**: LLM judges following detailed evaluation guidelines to provide comprehensive assessment.
- **Self-Evaluation**: Models critiquing their own outputs to identify strengths and weaknesses.

## 3. Text Generation Evaluation

- **Generate Until**: Models generate text until reaching predefined stopping criteria, allowing evaluation of free-form generation capabilities.
- **Instruction Following**: Assessment of how well models follow specific instructions in their generated outputs.
- **Factual Consistency**: Verification that generated content remains factually accurate and consistent.

## 4. Likelihood-Based Evaluation

- **Conditional Loglikelihood**: Calculates log probability of a target string given an input, measuring how likely the model finds specific completions.
- **Rolling Loglikelihood**: Calculates log probability of an entire input string, useful for measuring perplexity and fluency.
- **Rank-Based Metrics**: Evaluates how highly the model ranks correct answers among alternatives.

Incorporating these evaluation methods into your LLM development workflow helps ensure more comprehensive assessment of model capabilities and limitations. For complex applications, combining multiple evaluation techniques provides the most complete understanding of model performance.
