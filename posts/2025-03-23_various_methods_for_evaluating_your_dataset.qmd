## Part 1: Theoretical Evaluation Methods
:::

Proper evaluation is crucial for understanding language model capabilities. Here are several key methods used in frameworks like EleutherAI's lm-evaluation-harness:

The evaluation methods discussed below focus on assessing model generations and outputs, not training-related metrics like loss functions. While model training objectives and evaluation can be interlinked, this guide specifically addresses post-training evaluation techniques that measure the quality and usefulness of model outputs rather than optimizing the training process itself.

## Training-Related Evaluation Methods

### 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Evaluation

- **Holdout Validation**: Setting aside a portion of supervised examples to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Task-Specific Benchmarks**: Evaluating SFT models on standardized benchmarks relevant to the fine-tuning objective.
- **Cross-Validation**: Using techniques like k-fold validation to ensure robust performance across different data splits.
- **Learning Curve Analysis**: Tracking performance improvement as a function of training data volume to determine data efficiency.

### 2. Preference Dataset Evaluation

- **Preference Agreement**: Measuring how well a model's outputs align with human preferences from datasets like Anthropic's Helpful and Harmless dataset.
- **DPO Metrics**: Evaluating Direct Preference Optimization by measuring the gap between chosen vs rejected responses.
- **Preference Consistency**: Assessing whether model preferences remain consistent across similar queries or contexts.
- **Preference Distribution Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of model preferences across different types of queries to identify biases.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Based Evaluation

- **Reward Function Analysis**: Evaluating the correlation between reward function scores and actual human preferences.
- **RLHF Alignment**: Measuring how well Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns model outputs with human expectations.
- **Policy Drift**: Tracking how model behavior changes through reinforcement learning iterations.
- **Reward Hacking Detection**: Identifying cases where models optimize for reward signals without achieving the intended behavior.

## Human and Automated Evaluation Methods

### 1. Human Evaluation Methods

- **Direct Assessment**: Human evaluators rate model outputs on dimensions like helpfulness, accuracy, harmlessness, and overall quality.
- **Comparative Judgment**: Evaluators choose between outputs from different models without knowing their source, establishing relative quality.
- **Structured Annotation**: Detailed feedback using specific rubrics to evaluate particular aspects of model performance.

### 2. LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Using capable language models to choose between two model outputs, scaling evaluation while maintaining correlation with human judgments.
- **Absolute Scoring**: LLM judges rating individual responses on specific criteria using predefined scales.
- **Rubric-Based Evaluation**: LLM judges following detailed evaluation guidelines to provide comprehensive assessment.
- **Self-Evaluation**: Models critiquing their own outputs to identify strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. Text Generation Evaluation

- **Generate Until**: Models generate text until reaching predefined stopping criteria, allowing evaluation of free-form generation capabilities.
- **Instruction Following**: Assessment of how well models follow specific instructions in their generated outputs.
- **Factual Consistency**: Verification that generated content remains factually accurate and consistent.

### 4. Likelihood-Based Evaluation

- **Conditional Loglikelihood**: Calculates log probability of a target string given an input, measuring how likely the model finds specific completions.
- **Rolling Loglikelihood**: Calculates log probability of an entire input string, useful for measuring perplexity and fluency.
- **Rank-Based Metrics**: Evaluates how highly the model ranks correct answers among alternatives.

## Part 2: Inference Optimization Techniques
:::

While evaluation helps us understand model capabilities, we also need methods to optimize inference - the process of generating responses from our models. These techniques improve output quality without changing the underlying model weights.

### 1. Sampling and Decoding Strategies

- **Rejection Sampling**: Generating multiple candidate responses and filtering based on quality criteria, only accepting outputs that meet specific thresholds.
- **Temperature Tuning**: Adjusting sampling temperature to control randomnessâ€”lower values for more deterministic outputs, higher values for more creative ones.
- **Top-p/Nucleus Sampling**: Restricting token selection to the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold, balancing diversity and quality.
- **Model Ensembling**: Combining outputs from multiple models through voting or averaging to improve robustness and accuracy.
- **Random Selection**: Generating outputs from multiple models and randomly selecting between them to increase response diversity.

### 2. Prompt Engineering Techniques

- **Prompt Variations**: Testing different phrasings of the same instruction to identify optimal prompting strategies.
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Leveraging in-context examples to guide model behavior without additional training.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model through explicit reasoning steps to improve output quality.
- **System Prompt Tuning**: Systematically varying system prompts to optimize for specific behaviors or capabilities.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Adaptively modifying prompts based on context or previous model outputs.

## Part 3: Rebuilding Character AI (Chai AI)
:::

In this upcoming section, we'll put theory into practice by rebuilding a character-based AI system similar to Character AI. We'll apply the evaluation methods discussed in Part 1 to create, train, and refine conversational AI characters.

*Coming soon...*

When designing an evaluation strategy, it's important to select methods appropriate to your specific use case and development stage. Combining multiple evaluation approaches provides a more comprehensive understanding of model performance across different dimensions and helps identify areas for targeted improvement.
