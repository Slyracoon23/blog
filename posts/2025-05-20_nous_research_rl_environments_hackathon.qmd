I recently participated in the Nous Research RL Environments Hackathon. It was a great experience and I learned a lot. I thought I'd share my experience here.

## The Hackathon

The hackathon was a 3 day event where we were tasked with building a reinforcement learning environment. We were given a prompt and we had to build an environment that would be able to solve the task.
