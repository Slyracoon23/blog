    " ## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " Image embeddings are numerical representations of images that capture their semantic content in a way that's useful for machine learning algorithms. At their core, embeddings are dense vectors—typically consisting of hundreds or thousands of floating-point numbers—that represent images in a high-dimensional space where similar images are positioned close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Why Do We Need Image Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Images in their raw pixel form are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **High-dimensional**: A 224x224 RGB image contains 150,528 pixel values\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Not semantically organized**: Similar-looking images might have very different pixel values\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Difficult to work with**: Comparing raw pixels doesn't capture semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Embeddings solve these problems by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Reducing dimensionality**: Typically to a few hundred or thousand dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Capturing semantics**: Images with similar content have similar embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Enabling efficient search**: Finding similar images becomes a vector similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Supporting transfer learning**: Pre-trained embeddings can be used for various downstream tasks"

    " ## How Image Embeddings Work\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Modern image embeddings are typically created using deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs). These networks learn to transform raw pixels into compact, semantically meaningful representations through extensive training on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The process generally involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Training**: Neural networks are trained on large image datasets, often using self-supervised or weakly-supervised learning approaches\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Feature extraction**: The trained network processes an image through its layers\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Embedding generation**: The network's final or penultimate layer outputs become the embedding vector\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " These embeddings can then be used for various tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Image similarity**: Finding visually or semantically similar images\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Image classification**: Categorizing images into predefined classes\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Image retrieval**: Finding relevant images based on text queries\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Zero-shot learning**: Recognizing objects the model wasn't explicitly trained on\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Transfer learning**: Using pre-trained embeddings for new tasks with limited data"

    " #### From CLIP to SigLIP to SigLIP 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Vision-language models have evolved considerably in recent years:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **CLIP and ALIGN**: These pioneered the approach of jointly training image and text encoders to understand the semantic relationship between visual data and natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ![Contrast function comparison between CLIP and SigLIP](https://i.imgur.com/GH9sai5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **SigLIP (1st generation)**: Improved upon CLIP by replacing its contrastive loss function with a simpler pairwise sigmoid loss. Instead of requiring a global view of pairwise similarities for normalization (as in contrastive learning), the sigmoid loss operated only on image-text pairs, allowing for better scaling and improved performance even with smaller batch sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **SigLIP 2**: Extends this foundation by incorporating several additional training techniques into a unified recipe, creating more powerful and versatile vision-language encoders that outperform their predecessors across all model scales"

    " #### Enhanced Training Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " SigLIP 2's functioning is fundamentally based on its innovative training approach that combines multiple previously independent techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Extended Training Objectives**: While preserving the original sigmoid loss function, SigLIP 2 integrates several additional training objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Captioning-based pretraining to enhance semantic understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Self-supervised losses including self-distillation and masked prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Online data curation for improved quality and diversity of training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Multilingual Capabilities**: The model is trained on a more diverse data mixture that incorporates de-biasing techniques, leading to significantly better multilingual understanding and improved fairness across different languages and cultures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Technical Implementation**: SigLIP 2 models use the Gemma tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 256,000 tokens, allowing for better representation of diverse languages"

    " ## Guidelines for Choosing the Right SigLIP 2 Variant\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " When selecting a SigLIP 2 variant for your application, consider these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### For Resource-Constrained Environments:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Use Base models**: The ViT-B (86M) models provide a good balance between performance and efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Stick with 224px/256px resolution**: This minimizes memory usage and computation\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Consider quantization**: SigLIP 2 models can be quantized for further efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### For Production Applications with Balanced Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **SigLIP 2 So400m variants**: These shape-optimized models provide excellent accuracy without the computational demands of the largest models\n",
    "\n",
    " - **384px resolution**: A good balance between detail capture and resource usage\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Standard (non-NaFlex) variants**: Unless you specifically need aspect ratio preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### For Maximum Quality:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **SigLIP 2 Giant (g) models**: These 1B parameter models provide the highest accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    " - **512px resolution**: Maximizes detail capture for complex scenes\n",
    "\n",
    " - **NaFlex variant**: If working with documents or aspect-sensitive content\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### For Document Understanding or OCR:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **NaFlex variants**: Essential for preserving text layout and aspect ratios\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Higher resolutions**: Crucial for legibility of small text\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Consider So400m or Large models**: These capture more fine-grained details"

    " ## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " In this notebook, we've explored the concept of image embeddings and specifically delved into SigLIP 2, Google's advanced multilingual vision-language encoder. We've seen how image embeddings work, the technical evolution from CLIP to SigLIP to SigLIP 2, and the key capabilities that make SigLIP 2 stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    " Through practical examples, we've demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. How to perform zero-shot image classification\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. How to compute image-text similarity\n",

    " 3. How to visualize and cluster embeddings\n",

    " 5. How to compute image-to-image similarity\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. How to build a simple image search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Image embeddings like those produced by SigLIP 2 are foundational to modern computer vision applications, enabling efficient search, classification, and multimodal understanding. As models continue to evolve, we can expect even more powerful and versatile embeddings that further bridge the gap between vision and language understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The flexible architecture and variant options make SigLIP 2 adaptable to a wide range of applications, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance systems requiring maximum accuracy. By understanding these tradeoffs, you can select the most appropriate SigLIP 2 variant for your specific use case, whether you prioritize efficiency, accuracy, or specialized capabilities like document understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The multilingual capabilities and enhanced training methodology of SigLIP 2 make it particularly valuable for building more inclusive and accurate AI systems that can understand visual content across different languages and cultures."
