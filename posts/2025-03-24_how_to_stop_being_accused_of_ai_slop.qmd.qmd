title: "How to Stop Being Accused of AI-Generated Content"
subtitle: "Practical strategies for writing that stands out from AI-generated text"
---

Yesterday, I was accused of writing AI-generated content. I won't deny it - in fact, approximately 80-90% of my content is indeed AI-generated. However, the critics labeled it as "wrong," "bad," or "AI slop," despite my careful proofreading and review process.

This raises an important question: how can writers effectively communicate to readers that their AI-generated content has been thoroughly vetted? As an engineer at heart, I decided to approach this challenge by developing a tool that would help readers identify which sections have been verified and properly attributed to their original sources.


This is will be an exploration of the current state of AI writing, the challenges of AI-human collaboration, and potential technical solutions.

## 2. The Current State of AI Writing


Since the advent of LLMs, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated content. From a simple blog post to a youtube video, AI-generated content is everywhere. 

During a Council on Foreign Relations event in March 2025, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that within 3 to 6 months, AI will be writing 90% of code, with the potential for AI to handle essentially all coding tasks within a year[^1]. While this prediction has sparked debate in the tech community, it highlights the growing impact of AI on content creation across industries.
