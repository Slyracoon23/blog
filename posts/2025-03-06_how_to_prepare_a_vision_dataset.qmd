The latest trend in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly toward adding multi-modality, with vision becoming an especially important mode for modern AI systems. These models need to both understand and work with visual data alongside text, creating new opportunities and challenges for AI practitioners.

This post will walk you through the comprehensive process of preparing a high-quality vision dataset. I won't go much in detail how the internal of vision models work. I recommed you watch Trelis Research videos on this topic [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-nF-48rDIM&list=PLWG1mVtuzdxcYamFhHJjQg_TmgId6tETX).

Instead, I'll focus on how to create effective benchmarks for evaluation, and in subsequent blog posts, we'll explore how to leverage these datasets to fine-tune and enhance multimodal LLMs.

All the code used in this article is available on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-_966MqWZQXyX4QvQpZksvRqdZKZKZK?usp=sharing).

## Understanding the Dataset Requirements for Vision-Language Models

Before we start, let's briefly understand the type of datasets that are required for vision-language models.

A basic vision-language model consists of two components:

1.  A vision encoder that extracts features from the input image.
2.  A language model that generates a text description of the image.

The vision encoder is a model that takes an image with RGB values as input and outputs a vector of fixed size. Usually, this is a pre-trained model like EVA-CLIP or ViT.

The language model is a model that takes a text as input and outputs a next token prediction. Usually, this is a pre-trained model like LLama or Phi or Qwen models.

There is also a projection or cross-modality projector adapter. Essentially, it's a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that takes the feature vector from the vision encoder and projects it to the same embedding space as the language model. Think of it as an adapter that needs to be trained to bridge the gap between the vision and language modalities.

This is the basic architecture of a vision-language model.

But we are more interested in what data is needed to train this model which will in turn tell us what data is needed to create a benchmark for evaluation.

## Training Data

The training data for a vision-language model typically consists of image-text pairs. Here's a basic example of what a training sample might look like:

*Image source: [Laion-AI/hf-laion-vision-qa-captioning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Laion-AI/hf-laion-vision-qa-captioning)*


And here's a basic example of what a training sample might look like:

``` json
{
  "id": "sample_001",
  "image": "path/to/image.jpg",
  "conversations": [
    {
      "from": "human",
      "value": "<image>\nWhat can you see in this image?"
    },
    {
      "from": "assistant",
      "value": "The image shows a golden retriever puppy sitting on green grass. The puppy has light golden fur and is looking directly at the camera with its tongue slightly out. There's a red ball next to it, and trees can be seen blurred in the background. The lighting suggests it's a sunny day."
    }
  ]
}
```

Where `<image>` is a special token that tells the model that we are referring to an image.

This basic example is from "Efficient Multimodal Learning from Data-centric Perspective" and "SVIT: Scaling up Visual Instruction Tuning", which demonstrate similar conversation formats for vision-language model training.
