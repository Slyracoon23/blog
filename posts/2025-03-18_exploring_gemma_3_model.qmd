Building upon the success of previous Gemma models, which have seen over **100 million downloads** and inspired **60,000+ community variations**, Gemma 3 brings multimodality, enhanced language support, and improved reasoning to Google's open model ecosystem according to [Google's developer blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma3/).

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Innovations in Gemma 3
- **Multimodal capabilities** in all models except the 1B variant
- **Extended context windows** of up to 128K tokens
- **Support for 140+ languages** in the larger models
- **Significantly improved efficiency-to-performance ratio**
:::

## The Gemma 3 Family: An Overview

Gemma 3 comes in four different parameter sizes to accommodate various hardware setups and performance needs: 1 billion, 4 billion, 12 billion, and 27 billion parameters as detailed on [Google's Blog](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3). These models are built from the same research and technology that powers Google's flagship Gemini 2.0 models but optimized for more efficient operation. Each size is available in both *pre-trained versions* (which can be fine-tuned for specific domains) and *general-purpose instruction-tuned variants*.

| Model Size | Specifications | Capabilities |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Gemma 3 1B** | • 1 Billion parameters<br>• 32K token context<br>• Trained on 2 trillion tokens | • Text only (no images)<br>• English language only<br>• Optimized for low-resource devices<br>• Ideal for simple on-device applications |
| **Gemma 3 4B** | • 4 Billion parameters<br>• 128K token context<br>• Trained on 4 trillion tokens | • Multimodal (images and text)<br>• 140+ languages supported<br>• Good balance of performance and efficiency<br>• Supports function calling |
| **Gemma 3 12B** | • 12 Billion parameters<br>• 128K token context<br>• Trained on 12 trillion tokens | • Multimodal (images and text)<br>• 140+ languages supported<br>• Enhanced reasoning capabilities<br>• Can process ~30 high-res images or 300-page book |
| **Gemma 3 27B** | • 27 Billion parameters<br>• 128K token context<br>• Trained on 14 trillion tokens | • Multimodal (images and text)<br>• 140+ languages supported<br>• Highest performance in the family<br>• LMSys Elo score of 1339 |

What makes Gemma 3 particularly noteworthy is its ability to deliver **near state-of-the-art performance** while requiring *significantly fewer computational resources* than competitors. Google claims Gemma 3 achieves **98% of DeepSeek's R1 accuracy** (with Elo scores of 1338 versus 1363) while using only **one NVIDIA H100 GPU** compared to R1's estimated requirement of 32 GPUs, according to [ZDNet's report](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-claims-gemma-3-reaches-98-of-deepseeks-accuracy-using-only-one-gpu/).

## Technical Architecture and Innovations

Gemma 3's impressive efficiency-to-performance ratio stems from several architectural innovations. The model employs sophisticated attention mechanisms that go beyond traditional *Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)* technology as explained by [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-unveils-gemma-3-ai-mode-.cGGCsMoSo2X_pTrtcBw_Q). To achieve its extended context length, Google first pretrained the models with 32k token sequences, then scaled the 4B, 12B, and 27B variants to handle 128k tokens at the end of pretraining, saving significant computational resources.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Technical Breakthrough
The positional embeddings were significantly upgraded, with the RoPE base frequency increased from 10k in Gemma 2 to **1 million** in Gemma 3, and scaled by a factor of 8 to accommodate longer contexts.

The positional embeddings were significantly upgraded, with the RoPE base frequency increased from 10k in Gemma 2 to 1M in Gemma 3, and scaled by a factor of 8 to accommodate longer contexts according to [Hugging Face's analysis](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3). KV cache management was optimized using a *sliding window interleaved attention approach*, with the ratio of local to global layers adjusted from 1:1 to 5:1 and the window size reduced to 1024 tokens (down from 4096).

Training data volume scaled with model size: **2 trillion tokens** for the 1B model, **4 trillion** for 4B, **12 trillion** for 12B, and **14 trillion tokens** for the 27B model, all processed using Google TPUs with the JAX framework. A key technique enabling Gemma 3's efficiency is *distillation*, whereby trained weights from larger models are extracted and transferred to the smaller Gemma 3 models, as described by [Google's developers](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma3/).

## Capabilities and Features

Gemma 3 introduces several impressive capabilities:

### Multimodal Processing
All models except the 1B variant can process both images and text, enabling applications that analyze visual content alongside textual data. The models can handle **text, images, and even short videos**, making them versatile tools for content analysis as noted on [Google's Blog](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/) and [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-unveils-gemma-3-ai-mode-.cGGCsMoSo2X_pTrtcBw_Q).

::: {.callout-note}
## Video Processing Approach
While Gemma 3 can process videos, it's worth noting that its video understanding works by processing linearly spaced image frames sampled from the video. The model typically samples a fixed number of frames at regular intervals throughout the video, then analyzes these frames using its vision capabilities and integrates information across them to understand temporal relationships. This approach allows Gemma 3 to handle video content without requiring specialized video-specific architecture components.
:::

### Extensive Language Support
The 4B, 12B, and 27B models support over **140+ languages**, while the 1B model focuses on English only. This multilingual capability makes Gemma 3 suitable for global applications and diverse user bases.

### Long Context Windows
Gemma 3 offers expanded context windows: 32k tokens for the 1B model and **128k tokens** for the larger variants. This allows the models to process approximately *30 high-resolution images*, a *300-page book*, or over an *hour of video* in a single context window.

::: {.callout-important}
## Performance Impact
The extended context window is not just a numeric improvement—it fundamentally changes what these models can process in a single pass, enabling entirely new use cases that weren't possible with previous models.
:::

### Advanced Functionality
The models support *function calling* and *structured output*, enabling task automation and the creation of agentic experiences. Their reasoning capabilities have been enhanced for better performance in math, coding, and instruction following as detailed by [Google's developers](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma3/).

## ShieldGemma 2: Enhanced Safety Features

Alongside Gemma 3, Google has also released **ShieldGemma 2**, an enhanced version of the model that includes additional safety features and guardrails. ShieldGemma 2 is specifically designed to address concerns around potentially harmful outputs while maintaining the impressive capabilities of the base models.

ShieldGemma 2 builds upon Google's *responsible AI principles* and incorporates advanced techniques to:
- Filter out harmful content
- Better detect and refuse problematic requests
- Ensure outputs adhere to safety guidelines

This makes it particularly suitable for customer-facing applications and environments where content safety is paramount.

Like the main Gemma 3 models, ShieldGemma 2 is available through Google's AI platforms and can be accessed via the same channels as the standard models. Developers concerned with the safety aspects of AI deployment should consider ShieldGemma 2 as their starting point.

## Performance and Benchmarks

Gemma 3's 27B instruction-tuned model achieves an impressive LMSys Elo score of 1339, placing it among the **top 10 best models**, including leading closed ones according to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma3) and [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-claims-gemma-3-reaches-98-of-deepseeks-accuracy-using-only-one-gpu/). This score is comparable to OpenAI's o1-preview and surpasses other non-thinking open models.

![Gemma 3 27B IT achieves a competitive Elo score of 1338 in the Chatbot Arena rankings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/gemma3/chatbot-arena.png)
